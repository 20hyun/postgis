Translation files for the PostGIS manual.

Compilation of the files require the ``poxml`` package,
part of the KDE development kit.

Run ``make`` in language directories to generate the 
localized manual.

Run ``make update-po`` from the parent directory to
update the translation files to be in sync with the 
official documentation.

Using transifex
---------------

Transifex web-ui to translation was setup here:
https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/postgis-1

Run ``make update-tx`` from the parent directory to
update the transifex command-line tool configuration,
found in ../.tx/config (only needed when new doc sources
are added);

Push locally updated templates to transifex with ``tx push -t``.

Push locally updated translations to transifex with ``tx push -s``.
The --skip switch makes upload continue on import failure (useful
when some of the translation files have no translations at all).

Pull remotely updated translations with ``tx pull``

See ``tx help``.
