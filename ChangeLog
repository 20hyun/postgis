	* lwgeom/lwgeom_functions_basic.c: #HISTORY: Fix for GBT#83:
	  "ST_Multi on curved polygon gives ERROR: Unknown geometry type:
	  0". On reflection, ST_Multi() can only operate on standard POINT,
	  LINESTRING and POLYGON types as the only MULTI geomtypes are
	  MULTIPOINT, MULTILINESTRING and MULTIPOLYGON. This was caused by
	  the introduction of the curve crashing fixes in 1.3.4.

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_functions_lrs.c, lwgeom/ptarray.c: Lightbulb
	  moment: the fix for GBT#21: locate_along_measure: wrong values,
	  invalid data required extra work as floating point errors could
	  still be introduced by the removal of the memcpy(). In fact it
	  was the clipping logic that was wrong, so this patch re-adds the
	  memcpy() in the correct place(s) and corrects the clipping flags
	  to remove this floating point error. With thanks to Stephen
	  Davies.

2008-11-25 10:06  mcayland

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_estimate.c: Quick fix for GBT#72:

	  CIRCULAR STRING except that it occurs in a different place.

	* Makefile.config.in: Update new version of the sed command -

2008-11-11 17:27  mcayland

	* Makefile.config.in: Change Makefile.config.in to use sed instead
	  of cut to allow us to filter non-numeric parts of `pg_config
	  --version` when finding the currently installed PostgreSQL
	  version.

2008-11-07 13:54  mcayland

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_transform.c: After a quick sanity grep, I noticed
	  that ST_Transform() was also susceptible to crashing on curve
	  types in the same way as the previous two fixes. Hence I'm
	  committing a fix now before Regina finds it and logs another bug
	  report :)

2008-11-07 13:45  mcayland

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_functions_basic.c: Fix GBT#69: ST_Translate crashes
	  when fed circular string. lwgeom_affine_recursive() needs to know
	  about the new lwgeom_getcurve_inspected() function.

2008-11-07 13:18  mcayland

	* lwgeom/liblwgeom.h, lwgeom/lwgeom.c, lwgeom/lwgeom_api.c: Undo
	  commits 3270 & 3271. It has been discovered the
	  lwgeom_inspected_* routines correctly inspect CURVEPOLYGONs
	  implicitly, and so it's just the curve types that need fixing.

2008-11-07 12:57  mcayland

	* lwgeom/liblwgeom.h, lwgeom/lwgeom.c: Add missing LWCURVE cast

2008-11-07 11:47  mcayland

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_functions_basic.c: Fix GBT#70: ST_NPoints Crashes

	  lwgeom_getcurve_inspected() function.

2008-11-07 11:41  mcayland

	* lwgeom/liblwgeom.h, lwgeom/lwgeom_api.c: Add missing

	  of the latest GBT fixes.

2008-11-07 01:03  mleslie

	* lwgeom/liblwgeom.h, lwgeom/lwcurve.c: Updated the curve box3d
	  algorithm to use the floating point comparison operators.

2008-11-06 17:13  mcayland

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_dump.c: Fix for GBT#66: ST_Dump kills backend when

2008-11-05 20:49  pramsey

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_geos_c.c, lwgeom/lwgeom_rtree.c,
	  lwgeom/lwgeom_rtree.h, regress/regress_ogc_prep.sql,

	  shortcut case and the GEOS shortcut case interleave and use the
	  same cache area.

	* doc/postgis.xml: amend ST_Shift..

2008-11-05 11:27  mcayland

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_gml.c: Fix ST_AsGML() not recognising
	  GEOMETRYCOLLECTION as a valid geometry type from my GBT#65 fix :(

2008-11-05 11:17  mcayland

	* regress/geojson_expected, regress/kml_expected: Fix regression
	  tests reporting incorrect failures due to a change of output
	  caused by r3244.

2008-11-05 11:03  mcayland

	* lwgeom/lwgeom.c: Fix for GBT#68 - ST_Shift_Longitude doesn't work
	  with MULTIPOINT. Looks like this was just a simple mistake in the
	  code. I've also improved the error message to return the proper
	  type name instead of just a number.

2008-11-04 20:29  robe

2008-11-04 14:11  mcayland

	* lwgeom/liblwgeom.c: Fix lwgeom_typename() not returning a valid
	  string for any of the newer geometry types.

2008-11-04 13:58  mcayland

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_gml.c: Fix for GBT#65: ST_AsGML kills the backend
	  when fed a CIRCULAR STRING. The default code attempts to inspect
	  any unknown geometry which fails on CIRCULARSTR
	  ING. A longer term fix may be to fix CIRCULARSTRING so that it
	  can be inspected, however the fix here is to throw an ERROR for
	  unknown types just as the other As_*() functions do.

2008-11-04 13:17  robe

	* postgis_comments.sql: More protos for KML

2008-11-04 01:49  robe

2008-10-30 23:02  mcayland

	* doc/postgis.xml, lwgeom/lwgeom_geojson.c, regress/geojson.sql,
	  regress/geojson_expected: Fix regression test differences between
	  different platforms in the AsGeoJSON regression code. There were
	  two issues: firstly, the original regression tests included
	  precision information > 15 significant figures, and secondly the
	  GeoJSON code was exposing BOX2DFLOAT4 information to the client
	  instead of calculating the true bounding box. With thanks to
	  Olivier Courtin.

2008-08-02 08:40  mcayland

	* doc/postgis.xml: Copy the JDBC documentation changes from SVN
	  trunk to the 1.3 branch related to ant, since ant has been the
	  preferred build system for a while but the documentation was
	  never updated to reflect this.

2008-07-31 06:35  robe

	* New -n switch to support DBF-only loading of attributes without
	  shapes.
	  Submitted by Regina Obe.

2008-04-12 10:16  mcayland

	* Remove svn:eol-style from regress_ogc_expected; MingW requires
	  unix line endings in order for the diff to work as expected.

2008-04-10 14:44  pramsey

	* Reduce FTDate field size to 8 bytes from 10. Matches other calls
	  in the file
	  now, no good explanation in code why it was 10 to start with.
	  http://postgis.refractions.net/pipermail/postgis-users/2008-April/019169.html

2008-04-10 06:40  mcayland

	* Another round of PostgreSQL 8.3 fixes, this time related to
	  arrays. Make sure that we use the supplied ArrayType pointer
	  macros, instead of attempting to access to cast directly to
	  ArrayType. This resolved GBT#13 where a "corrupted histogram"
	  error is thrown when using using ST_EstimatedExtent() under 8.3.

2008-04-09 19:52  pramsey

	* Change sr_id into an integer, per mca's suggestion.

2008-04-08 21:36  pramsey

	* Fix string literal comparison warnings: "comparison with string
	  literal results in
	  unspecified behaviour"

2008-04-07 20:09  pramsey

	* Rename all occurances of getopt to pgis_getopt to work around
	  OS/X 10.5 system function name collision.

2008-04-07 19:47  pramsey

	* Fix the ST_AsKML regression tests.

2008-04-07 19:47  pramsey

	* Allow conditional regression tests based on GEOS_VERNUM and move
	  the
	  cover/prepared tests into the appropriate buckets. Fix the
	  AT_AsKML
	  regression tests.

2008-04-05 14:49  pramsey

	* remove unloved header file

2008-03-31 11:16  mcayland

	* Remove the code that adds share/contrib/nad to the PROJ.4 search
	  path for PostgreSQL < 8.0 since the mechanism for determining the
	  path has changed from earlier versions, and this was mainly for
	  Win32 users. Also rename nad/ directory to proj/ to keep it
	  inline with an existing PROJ.4 installation.

2008-03-30 19:38  pramsey

	* small syntax errors in ST_YMAX, etc functions

2008-03-30 19:37  pramsey

2008-03-28 21:10  pramsey

	* Revert KML patch, bad puppy!

2008-03-28 21:04  pramsey

	* Added KML patch from Eduin Carillo.
	  http://code.google.com/p/postgis/issues/detail?id=17

2008-03-28 20:18  pramsey

	* Changed ifeq to ifndef for CXX macro test.

2008-03-28 20:17  pramsey

2008-03-28 20:03  pramsey

	* Added SVN support patch from Dr. Marco Hugentobler, as described
	  in
	  http://postgis.refractions.net/pipermail/postgis-devel/2008-February/002883.html

2008-03-28 19:25  pramsey

	* Added GEOS_VERNUM macro and protected GEOS 3.0/3.1 functionality
	  behind it.

2008-03-28 18:55  mcayland

	* Fix crash caused by double-free in LWGEOM_same - we were
	  accidentally freeing the 1st parameter twice instead of freeing
	  the second parameter. Thanks to Cliff Wright for the bug report.

2008-03-28 17:05  pramsey

	* Removed regress_ogc_prep from tests temporarily until a new GEOS
	  is released with support
	  for new predicates.

2008-03-27 21:18  mcayland

	* Fix bug with |>> and <<| operators - the BOX2D overabove and
	  overbelow functions were actually wrong, causing index scans to
	  return the wrong results. Per bug report from Tomas Karlsson.

2008-03-26 03:40  pramsey

	* Change link to postgis bug tracker

2008-03-21 08:17  mcayland

	* Resolve GBT bugs #2,#3 and #9 related to crashes when calling
	  aggregate functions under PostgreSQL 8.3 (all earlier versions
	  would not see the error). This was due to missing more VARSIZE
	  macros in the PostgreSQL 8.3 conversion. The complete list of
	  affected functions under PostgreSQL 8.3 is: ST_force_2d(),
	  ST_force_3dz(), ST_force_3dm(), ST_force_4d(), ST_Collect(),
	  ST_MakeLine(), ST_Polygonize(), ST_Union()/ST_GeomUnion(),
	  ST_MakePolygon()/ST_Polygon().

2008-02-12 15:05  pramsey

	* Document ST_SimplifyPreserveTopology(geometry,float)

2008-02-12 15:03  pramsey

	* Added hook to GEOSTopologyPreserveSimplify

2008-01-29 01:24  benjubb

	* Changed the interface for the GEOS prepared predicates.
	  ST_contains, ST_containsProperly, ST_covers, and ST_intersects
	  are now overloaded.
	  The new arguments style is ( geometry, geometry, integer). The
	  third argument is used to determine when the first argument
	  changes. The assumption is that when the third argument changes,
	  the first argument is assumed to have changed too. This
	  side-steps the issue of determining when the identity of the
	  first geometry changes.

2008-01-22 19:44  benjubb

	* Ammended to include prepared geometry cache code in scope of
	  PREPARED_GEOM symbol.

2008-01-22 00:24  benjubb

	* Modified to check version of GEOS and stub out prepared
	  predicates if GEOS is prior to 3.1.0

2008-01-18 18:57  benjubb

	* Made some minor changes suggested by Mark Cave-Ayland.

2008-01-18 01:05  benjubb

	* Added new function wrappers to expose prepared geometry
	  predicates:
	  ST_ContainsPrepared( geometry, geometry )
	  ST_ContainsProperlyPrepared( geometry, geometry )
	  ST_CoversPrepared( geometry, geometry )
	  ST_IntersectsPrepared( geometry, geometry )
	  
	  as well, this function was added, for orthogonality:
	  ST_ContainsProperly( geometry, geometry )

2008-01-18 01:04  benjubb

	* Added new functions to lwgeom_geos_c.c to support prepared
	  geometry predicates.
	  bool containsPrepared( geom, geom)
	  bool containsProperlyPrepared( geom, geom)
	  bool coversPrepared( geom, geom)
	  bool intersectsPrepared( geom, geom)

2008-01-18 00:59  benjubb

	* Tests for the prepared geometry predicates.
	  The tests were copied from regress_ogc, and modified.
	  Most of the tests use a pattern where the same function is
	  invoked three times with the same argument.
	  This tests the prepared geometry caching mechanism.
	  This testfile haven't been added to regress/Makefile yet, as it
	  fails for one case. This
	  probably due to a bug in GEOS.

2008-01-11 15:05  mcayland

	* Bump version number to 1.3.3SVN for next development cycle.

2008-01-11 15:04  mcayland

	* Rewrite the pgsql2shp connection string code so that it uses a
	  connection string, rather than setting environment variables.
	  MingW-compiled and MSVC-compiled apps seem to have great problems
	  passing the variables to each other, causing regression to fail.
	  With this fix (and a Makefile tweak), it is now possible to run a
	  MingW-compiled PostGIS against an MSVC compiled PostgreSQL and
	  pass all regression tests.

2007-12-03 23:10  pramsey

	* Fix up bad entities and screwed up programlistings from some
	  previous pretty-printing
	  run on the XML.

2007-12-02 20:37  mcayland

	* Commit updated versions of the ChangeLog and README.postgis (also
	  change some references in README.postgis from "run as root" to
	  "run as postgres", and correct the --with-pgsql and --with-geos
	  documentation)

2007-11-30 18:19  pramsey

	* Added release notes.

2007-11-30 13:04  mcayland

	* Fix the (E)WKB parser so that it performs validation checks in
	  the same way as the WKT parser, e.g. ensure POLYGON rings are
	  closed, LINESTRINGs consist of at least 2 points and that curves
	  have at least 3 points. As discovered when looking simplify() bug
	  submitted by Ivan Mincik.

2007-11-27 22:39  mcayland

	* Rename the existing get_int32() and get_uint32() functions to
	  lw_get_int32() and lw_get_uint32() respectively in order to avoid
	  a collision with functions of the same name in newer versions of
	  OS X. This should resolve the problem with PostGIS crashing on
	  some OS X installations. Many thanks to William Kyngesburye and
	  others for resolving this issue.

2007-11-27 22:19  mcayland

	* Extend the PROJ.4 search path to include
	  $sharedir/contrib/postgis/nad when looking for grid files. This
	  is mainly to allow Win32 builds to find grid files without having
	  to use a PROJ.4 DLL compiled containing a fixed path.

2007-11-23 10:42  mcayland

	* Apply Tom Glancy's patch to shp2pgsql which corrects an
	  off-by-one error in the field_width calculation when determining
	  which SQL numeric type is required depending upon the length of
	  the corresponding shapefile field. This should eliminate various
	  out of range error messages that may have appeared when
	  attempting to load a converted shapefile into PostgreSQL.

2007-11-23 10:24  mcayland

	* Commit a first attempt at an Ant build.xml file for the PostGIS
	  JDBC driver so finally all the Java drivers build with Ant for
	  consistency, plus we eliminate numerous cross platform problems.
	  As it stands, the build.xml file supports only the standard JDBC
	  driver - if you wish to use a JTS-enabled JDBC driver or run the
	  online regression tests then you must still use the Makefile. Any
	  help porting the remaining parts of the Makefile would be
	  appreciated.

2007-10-29 16:29  mcayland

	* Apply parts of Charlie Savage's MSVC patch - mainly tidying up
	  variable allocations so they appear at the start of functions,
	  but also making better use of the pj_get_errno_ref() which gets
	  rid of the auto-import warnings on MingW.

2007-10-29 14:22  mcayland

	* Remove version numbers from liblwgeom references in lwpostgis.sql
	  as per
	  http://postgis.refractions.net/pipermail/postgis-devel/2007-September/002764.html.
	  This should help make upgrades a lot easier for people since it
	  removes the need to change the SQL function definitions when
	  upgrading version. Note that this is a quick and dirty fix as I
	  didn't want to change Makefile.shlib too much - as soon as we
	  remove support for PostgreSQL < 8.0, we can use PGXS instead and
	  thus remove the redundant shared library code from PostGIS.

2007-10-29 13:44  mcayland

	* Commit Charlie Savage's patches (with additional comments) to the
	  bounding box/envelope functions to ensure that valid geometries
	  are always returned; in more specific terms, if a bounding box is
	  a point then a POINT is returned, and if a bounding box is
	  1-dimensional a LINESTRING is returned. Otherwise a POLYGON is
	  returned as per the old behaviour. For details see the thread in
	  the postgis-users archives Sept 2007 'How to get the centroid of
	  an bounding box using st_extent'.

2007-10-29 12:34  mcayland

	* Fix broken error message when attempting to deserialise a type
	  other than a point; the message should now correctly show the
	  name of the offending type. Patch supplied by Charlie Savage.

2007-10-23 00:19  pramsey

	* KML credits patch <yecarrillo>

2007-10-10 21:27  mcayland

	* Apply extra fixes for the reworked AsGML() function to ensure
	  that enough memory is allocated for the GML output. Patch
	  supplied by Barbara Phillipot.

2007-09-28 10:18  mcayland

	* Fix a mistake in my refactoring of the AsGML() patch for GML3
	  support - the detoasted geometry is now the second argument
	  rather than the first. Per report from Olivier Courtin.

2007-09-19 05:01  pramsey

	* Applied patch from Charlie Savage to make ST_Envelope return a
	  POINT
	  when the input geometry is a POINT or a one-part MULTIPOINT.

2007-09-06 16:03  mcayland

	* Commit modified version of Barbara Phillipot's GML patch to fix
	  existing output to make it GML2 compliant, plus add GML3 output
	  capability

2007-08-22 15:09  pramsey

	* Rename ST_GeomUnion to ST_Union in docs and ST_MemGeomUnion to
	  ST_MemUnion in
	  .sql.

2007-08-21 23:02  mcayland

	* Fix crash when calling ST_EndPoint caused by a double-free in
	  LWGEOM_endpoint_linestring. This bug has been there for a while -
	  thanks to Eric Francois for the bug report.

2007-08-15 14:39  snowman

	* - Include levenshtein difference in rating when doing city/state
	  match.

2007-08-13 16:30  pramsey

	* Increment version number to 1.3.2 for next development cycle

2007-08-13 16:12  pramsey

	* Version flip up to 1.3.1

2007-08-13 15:51  mcayland

	* Fixed spelling error for the word "geometry" thanks to Regina
	  Obe, plus added comment about initial PostgreSQL 8.3 support.

2007-08-13 07:27  mcayland

	* This time really fix the documentation missing tag problem...

2007-08-13 07:14  mcayland

	* Fix documentation since an error in the 1.3.0 release notes xml
	  caused the build to fail (this may need author review)

2007-08-13 07:06  mcayland

	* Remove warning about unused variable in lwgeom.c (it was a
	  leftover from the PostgreSQL 8.3 compatibility patch)

2007-08-09 22:50  mleslie

	* Added release notes and updated version numbers and release
	  dates.

2007-08-09 22:19  mleslie

	* Moved the intersects method back to the original definition and
	  disabled the new apparently broken implementation.

2007-08-09 16:57  mleslie

	* Bumped the version number to RC5.

2007-08-09 16:56  mleslie

	* Updated the regression tests for curved geoms to avoid the byte
	  ordering problems.

2007-08-03 20:58  mleslie

	* Removed an unused function that was erroneously committed.

2007-08-02 19:58  mleslie

	* Added PreparedGeometry and caching support to the intersects
	  function in the jts connector. Created wrapper functions for the
	  PreparedGeometry functionality.

2007-08-02 19:57  mleslie

	* Removed a call to the deprecated point_in_ring function.

2007-07-31 20:40  mleslie

	* Updated the version numbers.

2007-07-26 18:55  mleslie

	* Applyed Michael Fuhrs patch to fix the reserved word issue
	  against PostgreSQL 8.3.

2007-07-23 21:43  mleslie

	* Fixed the FP_LTEQ macro to accomodate values significantly larger
	  that zero.

2007-07-23 18:52  mleslie

	* Added the covers and coveredby functions to the jts connector.

2007-07-23 16:29  mleslie

	* Updated the loader to create the index after the data has been
	  loaded.

2007-07-20 04:29  pramsey

	* Fix some ST_ declarations that were missing.

2007-07-18 15:57  mleslie

	* Applying Michael Fuhrs patch to correct my attrocious selling.

2007-07-16 18:53  mleslie

	* Added notes about the implicit index operators on the relational
	  functions.

2007-07-16 18:26  mleslie

	* Resurrected the ST_LineToCurve regression tests, but commented
	  them out until ST_SnapToGrid excepts curves.

2007-07-16 18:06  mleslie

	* Upgraded the escaping of quotes from the deprecated backslashing
	  to the doubling of quotes.

2007-07-13 05:48  mcayland

	* Rollback experimental shp2pgsql escaping change that accidently
	  got included in the last commit :(

2007-07-13 05:42  mcayland

	* Correct previous commit for older PostgreSQL versions - the order
	  of the methods in PROJ4SRSCacheContextMethods is not consistent
	  between versions.

2007-07-12 20:33  mcayland

	* Add missing methods to the PROJ.4 cache memory context to prevent
	  a backend crash caused by a NULL pointer dereference when
	  PostgreSQL is trying to clean up memory contexts. Per report from
	  Tom Lane.

2007-07-12 17:20  mleslie

	* Removing the unsnappable test calls to LineToCurve.

2007-07-11 01:17  pramsey

	* Remove extra/debian, per recommendation from Stephen Frost

2007-07-10 21:12  pramsey

	* Remove templategis from make, install, clean targets.

2007-07-09 03:11  snowman

	* - Remove debugging NOTICE

2007-07-09 02:20  snowman

	* - Added print-print function for norm_addy type (norm_addy ->
	  varchar)
	  - Restructured geocode(), accept address in parsed norm_addy form
	  as well as unparsed varchar form. Return norm_addy type instead
	  of
	  varchar (use pprint_addy() if you want a varchar result instead)

2007-07-08 21:56  snowman

	* - City names are 90 characters (this matters more than you might
	  think because it affects the types returned from the various
	  calls and if they don't match subsequent geocode() queries in
	  the same session may complain about the planned record type not
	  matching across calls)

2007-07-06 16:45  pramsey

	* ST_Dwithin reference entry

2007-07-06 16:44  pramsey

	* Added ST_DWithin SQL function

2007-07-04 17:12  mleslie

	* Applied the patch from Michael Fuhr to fix the definition of
	  ST_PointN

2007-07-03 21:36  snowman

	* - Change to generic database name

2007-07-03 21:36  snowman

	* - Update install instructions

2007-07-03 21:32  snowman

	* Add in initial import scripts for importing the TIGER/Line
	  data into a PostGIS system. Could probably be improved to
	  accept more arguments/etc and require less direct script
	  modification to make it work. Also, not sure the polygons
	  are done perfectly yet. :/

2007-07-03 21:30  snowman

	* Add in broken out/updated normalize/geocode functions
	  - create_geocode.sql:
	  Main creation script for pulling in all the other
	  .sql files to create all the functions and whatnot
	  - normalize/
	  Normalization routines, includes mapping 'North' -> 'N',
	  'Virginia' -> 'VA', etc, etc.
	  - geocode/
	  Actual geocoding routines to find the point geometry of the
	  address. Includes interpolation across the linestring found
	  for the location (perhaps not the best), and fallbacks to
	  zip-code and city, state matches using the associated lookup
	  tables for those. Also currently returns a set rather than
	  a cursor, that's up for some debate but the cursor makes it
	  difficult to do things like fallback, imv. Especially since
	  references to it from another pl/pgsql function require it to
	  be a specific record type across multiple calls. That's
	  currently a problem. :/

2007-07-03 21:22  snowman

	* Initial import of utility functions, seperated into individual
	  files
	  for sanity.

2007-07-03 21:19  snowman

	* tables/- New scripts for roads_local/tiger_geocode_roads, clean
	  up lookup_tables
	  - roads_local.sql:
	  Script to create the road_local table from the completechain
	  table which is created by ogr2ogr. Mainly handles type
	  conversions. Also creates the tlid, cfcc, and geometry
	  indexes.
	  
	  - tiger_geocode_roads.sql:
	  Script to create the tiger_geocode_roads table which breaks
	  down the roads_local to just the street name, etc, much
	  smaller than roads_local but has the pointers to get back
	  to the full roads_local for address number matching, etc.
	  Also creates the appropriate indexes using soundex().
	  
	  - lookup_tables.sql:
	  - Add 'drop if exists' to make script easily re-runnable
	  - Add primary keys, good thing to have, and creates indexes
	  - Add st_code (TIGER/Line state code) to state_lookup
	  - Remove dup in street_type_lookup
	  - Add in building of:
	  place_lookup
	  county_lookup
	  countysub_lookup
	  zip_lookup_all
	  zip_lookup

2007-07-03 21:05  snowman

	* - Minor reorg, add in other parts of the initial load

2007-07-03 20:51  snowman

	* - Original tiger geocoder

2007-07-03 20:03  mleslie

	* Added a home for the tiger geocoder.

2007-06-28 22:46  mleslie

	* Added ST_Covers and ST_CoveredBy functions, as discussed at
	  http://lin-ear-th-inking.blogspot.com. Added regression tests and
	  documention for the new functions.

2007-06-28 20:21  mleslie

	* Added a 1D rtree for polygon segment indexing, and tied the index
	  into the point in polygon short-circuit of the contains, within,
	  intersects and disjoint methods. Added an index cache to the
	  comparitor methods to save index build times.

2007-06-28 20:16  mleslie

	* Added or updated debugging statements.

2007-06-28 20:14  mleslie

	* Altered the macro tests for pg_alloc, pg_realloc to only print
	  debugging information when alloc debugging is enabled.

2007-06-15 19:06  mleslie

	* Updated the regression test suite to allow variable results
	  depending on jts/geos availability.

2007-06-15 19:04  mleslie

	* Added curvey geometry recognition to the jts connector.

2007-06-12 14:46  pramsey

	* Typo corrections from Michael Fuhr.

2007-06-08 10:28  mcayland

	* Applied Michael Fuhr's patch to use explicit text casts where
	  required. Required for PostgreSQL 8.3 where many of the implicit
	  casts to text have been removed.

2007-06-07 16:16  mleslie

	* Added relational function definitions that inline index operators
	  for automagic index utilization.

2007-06-06 19:19  nbarker

	* Hibernate Spatial Criteria Queries and Dialect

2007-06-05 20:46  mleslie

	* Updated the docs to reflect the function name transition.

2007-06-05 20:45  mleslie

	* Reorganized the sqlmm function declarations to prevent
	  duplication and confusion.

2007-06-04 23:06  mleslie

	* Added versions of functions with standard ST (Spatial Type)
	  prefixes to any functions that were lacking them. Updated the
	  regression tests to include the new functions.

2007-06-01 20:56  mleslie

	* Ongoing PIP trauma. Addressed the issue of points in line with a
	  boundary segment, but not actually on it. Added appropriate unit
	  tests.

2007-06-01 12:44  mcayland

	* Reduce 'LWGEOM_gist_joinsel called with arguments that are not
	  column references' warning to DEBUG1; it's not really a problem,
	  and in cases where people a lot of these types of queries, the
	  logs get flooded with these NOTICEs. Per email from Flavio Perri.

2007-06-01 09:54  mcayland

	* Fixed bug #145 - RemovePoint Failure in the bugtracker. It was an
	  off-by-one error in ptarray.c which caused the penultimate point
	  to not be copied to the new geometry.

2007-06-01 07:01  mcayland

	* Fix broken docbook stylesheet search. AC_ARG_WITH only calls its
	  contents when a --with-* option is specified, so the search would
	  never be invoked in its current position. Moved the search into
	  the second macro argument, so it is now invoked if no --with-xsl
	  argument is specified, which I believe was the intended
	  behaviour.

2007-05-31 13:18  mcayland

	* Add support for the upcoming release of PostgreSQL 8.3. From
	  PostgreSQL 8.3, the internal structure of varlena datatypes has
	  changed and so any references to the size of the varlena and its
	  address must use the VARSIZE and SET_VARSIZE macros. Includes a
	  #define in pgsql_compat.h so that SET_VARSIZE still works with
	  the older PostgreSQL versions. Passes all regression tests under
	  PostgreSQL 8.2 and PostgreSQL 8.3. Thanks to David Techer and
	  Michael Fuhr for additional testing.

2007-05-28 15:34  mleslie

	* Added curve handling to getType, numGeometries, geometryN,
	  dimension, exteriorRing, numInteriorRings, interiorRingN, closed
	  (lwgeom_ogc.c) lwgeom_clone (lwgeom.c) and area. Added function
	  ST_CurveToLine and ST_LineToCurve. Added regression tests for
	  sql-mm geometries and related functions.

2007-05-22 22:10  mleslie

	* Added short-circuit calls for the point-in-polygon cases of
	  disjoint and intersect calls. Added regression tests for the new
	  short-circuits.

2007-05-14 18:04  mcayland

	* Bump SVN code version to 1.2.2SVN

2007-05-14 17:55  mcayland

	* Fix broken regress_proj expected results by removing the extra
	  DELETE at the end of the file.

2007-05-14 17:51  mcayland

	* Remove GEOS C++ API support from PostGIS HEAD; it's been broken
	  since 1.2.0 and so we require a minimum of GEOS 2.2.0 to compile
	  and run PostGIS. Includes alterations to autoconf to display an
	  error message during configure if the GEOS version is incorrect.
	  Passes all regression tests with GEOS 2.2.3 and GEOS 3.0.0rc4
	  using GEOS CAPI.

	* Edits from Bruce Rindahl

2007-01-26 15:11  mcayland

	* Refine previous patch to use a different delimiter than : (!) for
	  sed. This simplifies the Makefile and protects all the $*dir
	  arguments from escaping issues under Win32.

2007-01-19 09:44  strk

	* * extras/template_gis/Makefile: escape $bindir

	* Added 'with oids' specification to create table (oids are used
	  for the test).
	  'With oids' was available in postgresql 7.3.4 so we should not be

2006-03-27 09:33  strk

	* Used a larger grid for buffer() test, to account for rounding

2006-02-06 11:16  strk

	* Added uchar typedef

2006-02-06 11:12  strk

	  switches.

2006-02-01 20:48  strk

	* Portable tests for docdir and datadir, comments fixed.
	  Thanks to Havard Tveite for pointing out.

2006-01-29 13:54  strk

	* Fixed bug in SnapToGrid() bbox computation.
	  Previous policy (WHEN SIMPLE) turned out to be non-simple,
	  so this has been changed to TAINING.
	  Bbox will then be recomputed by scanning output coordinates
	  iff input had a bbox cache.
	  AUTOCACHE_BBOX define (the default) will still force a
	  computation of output box if worth it.
	  Regress tests added for the case reported on postgis-users
	  
	  Run of regress tests do not require postgis install
	  anymore. The library build in source tree will be
	  used for this purpose.
	  
	  Version bumped to 1.1.2 and CHANGES file updated.

	* Made AddGeometryColumn delete from geometry_column records which
	  would be incompatible with the one being added

2004-06-01 16:16  strk

	* Placed histogram2d type definition in a common place;
	  added find_extent(schema, table, column) and
	  build_histogram2d(histogram,
	  schema, table, column); modified update_geometry_stats() to make
	  use
	  of available f_table_schema and to set statistical fields to NULL
	  for stale records. Thanks to Carl Anderson for the ideas.

	  of bigint bug workaround.

2004-05-13 12:13  strk

	* Used DBFWriteAttributeDirectly interface for writing attributes.
	  This way we are not affected by shapelib long-integer bug.

2004-05-13 12:07  strk

	* Other fix in 3d handling - you should now be able to dump as 2d
	  or 3d any 2d or 3d object

2004-05-13 11:59  strk

	* Fixed bug in 3d features handling.

2004-05-13 09:40  strk

	  tolerance.

2004-04-27 07:44  strk

	* Removed use of geometryFactory->toGeometry(), indicated by Martin
	  Davis
	  as being intended for internal use only. Created a linear ring

	  to be 0).

2004-04-08 17:05  dblasby

	* Somehow the memory leak changes I made got removed - I've
	  re-added them.

2004-04-08 17:00  dblasby

	* Changed ggeometry_consistent to be aware of NULL queries. Ie.
	  select * from <table> where the_geom && null::geometry;
	  
	  This tends to happen when you're joining two tables using && and
	  the table
	  has NULLs in it.

2004-04-07 23:12  dblasby

	* Added a cstring(lwgeom) function that returns WKT!

2004-04-07 16:23  strk

	  postgis09=# select fluffType('POINT(0 0)');
	  flufftype
	  -------------------------
	  SRID=-1;MULTIPOINT(0 0)

2004-03-25 00:43  dblasby

	* added function fluffType() that takes POINT LINESTRING or POLYGON
	  type and converts it to a multi*.
	  Needs to be integrated into a proper Postgresql function and
	  given an
	  SQL CREATE FUNCTION

2004-03-22 09:39  strk

	* Moved AddGeometryColumn and DropGeometryColumn from USE_VERSION
	  blocks to the end of file. Here, differences between versions
	  are handled on a minimun-diff basis, making it easier to
	  understand
	  the differences and to modify the code. Also, diffs have been
	  splitted between pgsql < 73 and >= 73.
	  Added reduced-parameters wrappers to both functions.

2004-03-22 08:18  strk

	* postgis_new.sql build by default

	* minor clean and trying to figure out a memory bug. valgrind wasnt
	  helping, but
	  it went away.

	* changed error computation code to delta/totrows

2004-03-08 12:16  strk

2004-03-05 21:03  strk

	* Made the -bps switch specify the exact level(s) at which to run
	  the test

2004-03-05 18:25  dblasby

	* Empty files - preparing for writting actual code.

2004-03-05 18:23  dblasby

	* Same as the one in the above directory

2004-03-05 18:23  dblasby

	* moved to lwgeom/ directory

2004-03-04 13:50  strk

	* postgis_gist_sel(): added warnings if search_box goes outside of
	  histogram grid

2004-03-04 09:44  strk

	* The selectivity estimator does add the full value of each cell it
	  overlaps,
	  regardless of the actual overlapping area. Final gain is not
	  applied
	  (formerly 1 / minimun between average feature cells occupation
	  and
	  search_box cells occupation)

2004-03-03 21:59  strk

	* added check to keep selectivity value in the range of validity
	  (suggested by m.cave)

2004-03-02 11:39  strk

	* cpp call for postgis_new.sql creation uses shell redirection for
	  the output file

2002-10-24 15:53  pramsey

	* Added PGbox3d accessors for LLB and URB. Added PGgeometry update
	  to
	  account for SRIDs when they are present in the WKT. Submitted by
	  Rueben Schultz.

2002-10-17 17:06  chodgson

	* fixed the last compile warning on solaris/gcc

2002-10-17 16:45  chodgson

	* - cleaned up all the compiler warnings
	  - for getopt.c, this involved moving the line:
	  extern char *getenv(const char *name);
	  outside of the two nested #ifdefs that it was inside, as it is
	  always required (the code that calls it isn't inside any #ifdefs)
	  Perhaps this may break compilation in non-linux/gnu environments?

2002-05-06 17:35  chodgson

	* - changed add_to_geometry() and collector() so that the sql

	* Start of 0.7 documenation edits.

2002-05-02 22:25  dblasby

	* transform_geom() - if it gets and error -38 from PROJ.4 (couldnt
	  open
	  grid file) it will try to do the transform without a
	  a datum conversion. This usually occurs if you ask
	  for a re-projection for a point outside where you have
	  grid data for.

2002-04-30 23:37  dblasby

	* Better error reporting.

2002-04-30 23:20  dblasby

	* Added some debugging to transform.

2002-04-29 17:23  dblasby

	* Added distance_ellipsiod(point,point,ellipsoid)
	  (called distance_spheroid in SQL)

2002-04-26 22:50  chodgson

	* - cut the gist indexing-related functions out of postgis_ops.c
	  and put them in postgis_gist.c, then put the new gist indexing
	  functions for postgres >= 7.2 in the file postgis_gist_72
	  
	  - similarly, the sql definitions of the gist functions have been
	  split into their own new sql.in file, with postgis_gist_72.sql.in
	  containing the new postgres >= 7.2 definitions
	  
	  - the makefile has been updated to compile EITHER postgis_gist.c
	  OR postgis_gist_72.c, and also to process EITHER
	  postgis_gist.sql.in OR postgis_gist_72.sql and add the output to
	  the end of postgis.sql
	  
	  - in order to compile the gist functions for posgres 7.2 or
	  newer, make sure to point your PGSQL_SRC at the new source
	  directory, and uncomment the line in the makefile which says PG72
	  = 1 (near the top)
	  
	  - some functions that were previously in postgis_ops.c were moved
	  to postgis_fn.c, as part of a general cleanup I did when
	  splitting off the gist functions into their own file
	  
	  - some definitions that were previously in postgis.h
	  (unnecessarily) where removed, as they varied depending on which
	  version of postgis_gist was being used
	  
	  - also edited the loader/Makefile to clean up properly

2002-04-26 16:13  pramsey

	* Column name length limitation removed. Patch submitted by

	  function that
	  takes a group of geometries and turns them into a geometry
	  collection. For
	  example, "select collect(roadsgeom) from roadstable group by
	  roadname"
	  would return one geometrycollection for each unique road name.

2002-03-15 17:10  dblasby

	* ADD xmin(box3d) etc... for box3d's.

2002-03-14 19:35  jeffloun

	  the database.

2002-03-01 19:32  pramsey

	* Alter shp2pgsql in the -d case so that 'DELETE FROM' is used to
	  clear the
	  'GEOMETRY_COLUMNS' table during table drop instead of
	  DropGeometryColumns.
	  Patch submitted by Steffen Macke <sdteffen@yahoo.com>.

2002-02-27 00:38  dblasby

	* minor bug in geometry_to_text() for BOX3D only types fixed.

2002-02-27 00:06  dblasby

	  load, it will be NULL.

2002-02-23 19:04  pramsey

	  geometry
	  column, and addition of -g option to specific which geometry

	  from section 2.1.5.1
	  --------------------
	  startpoint(geometry) :- if geometry is a linestring, return the
	  first
	  point. Otherwise, return NULL.
	  
	  endpoint(geometry) :- if geometry is a linestring, return the
	  last
	  point. Otherwise, return NULL.
	  
	  from section 2.1.9.1/3.2.18.2
	  --------------------
	  
	  centroid(geometry) :- if geometry is a polygon (or multipolygon),
	  return
	  the mathematical centroid (no guaranteed to be on polygon),
	  otherwise
	  return NULL. I define centroid as the average location of all the
	  points
	  in the polygon (outer ring only). For multipolygons, average all
	  the
	  points on all the outer rings.
	  
	  from section 3.2.12.2/3.2.17.2
	  ---------------------
	  isclosed(geometry) :- if geometry is a linestring then returns
	  startpoint == endpoint. If its not a linestring then return NULL.
	  If
	  its a multilinestring, return true only if all the
	  sub-linestrings have
	  startpoint=endpoint.
