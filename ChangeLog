	  cleaning on error and corrupting shared memory when things are
	  cached. but at least regress.sql now passes under 9.2 edb 64

	* Associated CLI fix for #2272: shp2pgsql-gui crashes when given
	  filenames with dots.
	  
	  After some experimentation, the best solution seems to be to use
	  a separate scan to
	  remove the extension before finding the non-path section when
	  deriving the table
	  name.

2013-04-13 17:36  mcayland

	* Fix for bug #2272: shp2pgsql-gui crashes when given filenames
	  with dots.
	  
	  This was a combination of two bugs: firstly, we weren't
	  initialising the
	  state variable field_names to NULL, and so if the variable
	  happened to
	  be filled with junk and we were unable to import a shape file, we
	  would
	  end up freeing a random pointer.
	  
	  Secondly, shapelib tries to be clever and strip off any file
	  extension
	  by searching for a "." character from the end of the filename,
	  hence
	  causing the truncation of the filename. Resolve this by leaving
	  the
	  .shp/.dbf extension from the file selector in the filename string
	  so
	  that shapelib does the right thing.

	  changed to represent the average _compressed_ size rather
	  than the average _uncompressed_ size of non-null geometry
	  values. This may have some consequence on the planner (not

2013-02-17 19:27  robe

	* had type and name swapped

2013-02-17 18:37  robe

	* ST_MapAlgebra: create variablelist and move much of commentary to
	  that so page is more easily digestable

2013-02-17 16:24  dustymugs

	* Fixed handling of out-db rasters with no geotransform matrix

2013-02-16 21:47  dustymugs

2013-02-16 21:47  dustymugs

	* Update raster TODO as it was sorely out of date

2013-02-16 01:00  dustymugs

	* Faster ST_Union() done using memcpy when possible

2013-02-15 23:53  dustymugs

	* Changed how rasters with unknown SRID and default geotransform
	  are
	  handled when calling GDAL Warp API. Ticket #2203

2013-02-09 06:08  robe

	* change check geos to be 3.4 (3.4 is the new standard of
	  excellence)

2013-02-09 05:24  robe

	* get rid of use of xml tags in arg - messing up formatting of
	  cheat sheet gen

2013-02-09 05:17  robe

	* missed one

2013-02-09 05:16  robe

	* fix version number -- should change to read from config at some
	  point, but too lazy to figure that out right now

2013-02-09 04:29  robe

	* add styles to avoid page breaks in awkward places

2013-02-09 03:45  robe

	* update to summary of what's new in PostGIS 2.1 - this will be a
	  really slick release :). Fix doc links in cheatsheet generator

2013-02-07 20:49  pramsey

	* Expand size of generic cache to allow future
	  pointcloud cache to sneak into it if necessary

2013-02-07 17:16  dustymugs

	* Corrected use of pfree instead of PG_FREE_IF_COPY

2013-02-07 17:16  dustymugs

	* Additional assert() calls. Will need to add usage of NDEBUG flag
	  to turn
	  off assert() for non-debug builds

2013-02-07 06:31  robe

	* uhh how could we forget to mention the cool
	  ST_Union(rast,unionarg) is new in PostGIS 2.1. Got rid of some
	  other notes as its only that annoying ST_Union(rast,uniontype)
	  that's a sore in my back.

2013-02-06 21:38  robe

	* #2199: clarify ST_Union(rast) multiband union feature is just for
	  first variant. A bit too verbose, but at least I won't be
	  confused anymore.

2013-02-04 19:07  dustymugs

	* Fixed dimension error of bands when using ST_Tile on out-db
	  rasters.
	  Ticket #2198

2013-02-04 19:07  dustymugs

2013-02-02 23:48  robe

	* #2190: further cleanup of topology existence checking so
	  regresses for 9.3. Should pass with flying colors now.

2013-02-02 22:12  robe

	* fix for 9.3 -- pg 9.3 seems to throw errors sooner so we need to
	  check a topology exists before trying to query it.

2013-02-01 20:13  robe

	* fix gdal_translate examples (port now required) and have typos in
	  syntax

2013-01-29 15:25  dustymugs

2013-01-28 23:01  dustymugs

	* Fix function parameter value overflow that caused problems when
	  copying
	  data from a GDAL dataset. Problem first appeared in ST_Resize().
	  Ticket #2188

2013-01-28 23:01  dustymugs

	* Code cleanup of rt_raster_gdal_warp()

2013-01-26 18:17  robe

	* ST_Perimeter not being flagged in matrix as geography function
	  because of double function synopsis

2013-01-26 17:31  robe

	* link happiness -- add ref to postgresql math functions so people
	  aren't puzzled by degrees, pi, radians where they came from

2013-01-26 17:27  robe

	* clarify distance is in meters in the short-descrip that shows in
	  db environment

2013-01-26 17:22  robe

	* ST_Project -- somebody didn't follow protocol and didn't tag
	  PostGIS version when they added this

2013-01-26 02:42  robe

	* spell degrees correctly -- its degrees not degreees

2013-01-26 02:32  robe

	* #657: correct the documentation on ST_Project to reflect it
	  expects bearing measured in radians and how to handle for both
	  degrees and radians

2013-01-25 11:03  strk

	* Support dumps where the geometry column has a mixEdCaseD name

2013-01-18 08:55  robe

	* update news with new tiger geocoder features

2013-01-17 08:05  strk

	* Prefer boolean predicates over overlay ops in ST_ChangeEdgeGeom
	  
	  Further reduces robustness issues and squeezes another bit of
	  performance.

2013-01-16 21:42  strk

	* Drop useless input endpoints relate check in ST_ChangeEdgeGeom

2013-01-16 15:14  strk

	* Make ST_ChangeEdgeGeom motion collision detection code more
	  robust
	  
	  The new model avoids a call to GEOSSymDifference but rather
	  checks
	  each candidate node against both "motion ranges" containment.
	  It still constructs something, but only MULTIPOINT, which should
	  be safe. Haven't profiled but the new code should also be faster
	  than the previous. Fixes ticket #2176, includes testcase for it.

2013-01-16 14:24  robe

	* change to about link to show new website link

2013-01-16 09:42  robe

	* fix formatting and word changes to tiger extension install
	  section

2013-01-16 09:16  robe

	* update to reflect new protocol when we are on new site. Also to
	  update download links

2013-01-16 07:48  robe

	* move note into para

2013-01-16 07:38  robe

	  shuffle in future anchor doesn't change)

2012-12-27 12:56  strk

	* Drop "lwgeom_init_allocators" need, add "lwgeom_set_handlers"
	  
	  This change allows using liblwgeom from clients which cannot
	  define
	  C-level methods for link-back (e.g. python ctypes). See #2089.
	  
	  NOTE: existing clients should take care of calling the new
	  function
	  because their "lwgeom_init_allocators" won't be called anymore.
	  Failure to do so will result in default allocators / reporters
	  being used.
	  
	  Thanks Giuseppe Sucameli for the base work on this

2012-12-26 13:44  robe

	* Add add_search_path helper function and call it in install of
	  postgis_tiger_geocoder to add tiger to search path. Create
	  unpacked script for geocoder so can do CREATE EXTENSION
	  postgis_tiger_geocoder FROM unpackaged;

2012-12-21 22:55  dustymugs

	* More code and memory cleanup

2012-12-21 22:18  dustymugs

	* Additional cleanup and making sure to free memory when hitting
	  errors

	  set path and cleanup the make clean

2012-12-19 23:26  dustymugs

	* Stomp out memory leaks in CUnit tests

2012-12-19 23:26  dustymugs

	* Make sure to free OGR geometry when the geometry is empty

2012-12-19 23:26  dustymugs

2012-12-18 05:06  robe

	* #1959 remove sql_bits/mark_editable_objects.sql.in from upgrade
	  script. It is the one causing pg_extension table to bloat and in
	  theory not needed for upgrade since we don't change
	  spatial_ref_sys during upgrade.

2012-12-15 20:27  robe

	* add 2.0.2 as upgrade from path

2012-12-15 08:09  robe

	* #2147 upgrade topology doesn't work on Mac BSD sed doesn't
	  default to extended. Use already perl built topology upgrade
	  script instead as template for extension upgrade

2012-12-15 00:55  dustymugs

	* Fixed handling of identifiers with single quote (') such as in
	  O'Reilly.

	* Changed testing of extent geometry

2012-12-14 20:27  dustymugs

	* Updated raster2pgsql help and docs to reflect changes to
	  regular_blocking.

2012-12-14 20:27  dustymugs

	* regular_blocking constraint removed. regular_blocking column of
	  raster_columns now looks for spatially_unique and coverage_tile
	  constraints. Ticket #2150

2012-12-14 20:27  dustymugs

	* Added regression tests for ST_IsCoverageTile().

2012-12-14 20:27  dustymugs

	* Added support for padded edge tiles to ST_IsCoverageTile()

2012-12-14 20:27  dustymugs

	* Added support for no-band rasters to ST_Tile(raster)

2012-12-14 20:27  dustymugs

	* Added missing tickets and reorg of ticket list

2012-12-14 20:27  dustymugs

	* Added parameters to ST_Tile(raster) to control padding of
	  generated tiles.
	  ST_Tile(raster) no longer defaults to padding tiles. Ticket #2069

2012-12-14 20:26  dustymugs

	* Addition of coverage_tile constraint for raster. Ticket #2148

2012-12-14 20:26  dustymugs

	* Addition of ST_IsCoverageTile() to tell if tile is part of a
	  coverage

2012-12-14 20:26  dustymugs

	* Added raster's spatially_unique constraint. Ticket #2149. Still
	  needs
	  regression tests but won't happen until regular_blocking is
	  finished.

2012-12-14 20:26  dustymugs

	* Tweaked the extent computed for the extent constraint

2012-12-14 20:26  dustymugs

	* Changed blocksize constraint to permit multiple possible values.
	  Ticket
	  is #2143. We just need a coverage constraint and a spatially
	  unique
	  constraint to determine regularly blocked.

2012-12-14 20:26  dustymugs

	* Fixed incorrect return type in docs

2012-12-14 20:26  dustymugs

	* raster2pgsql no longer pads tiles by default based upon tile
	  position and tile
	  size. This is part of the refactoring to remove padded tiles.
	  Flag -P
	  added so that users can indicate that tiles should be padded.
	  Ticket #826.

2012-12-14 20:25  dustymugs

	* Removed hardcoded flags for raster2pgsql from run_test

	  talkative

2012-12-14 20:25  dustymugs

	  with < 2 vertices"
	  
	  The correct behavior is still being discussed here:

	  Better reduce the noise...

2012-12-12 15:52  strk

	* Return NULL when simplifying a line results in a line with < 2
	  vertices
	  
	  Also return NULL from ST_Simplify when the input is an empty
	  (null is a simpler form than EMPTY...)
	  
	  Yes, both break backward compatibility, but seem more consistent
	  to me. I'm still interested in allowing collapses avoidance but
	  I think consistency is also important.

2012-12-07 09:24  strk

	* Add a "TopoGeometry Editors" section
	  
	  I've added a toTopoGeom entry in this section for the sole

	  It's two overloaded functions, documented togheter in the latter

	  Replaces the iterated SymDifference used since 2005 with a more
	  scalable algorithm. The new algorithm removes from the
	  polygonized
	  result all polygons whose rings are known to be already
	  represented
	  by holes or shells of other polygons and finally runs a single
	  overlay operation (unary union).
	  
	  With the case attached to ticket #1806, ST_BuildArea completes
	  within 12 seconds using the new code while it takes 27 _minutes_
	  with the old. Both versions return the same result (according to

	  The original implementation set the has_z/has_m flags directly
	  based upon the -t parameter; however this lost the information
	  as to how many dimensions were specified. Resolve this by
	  specifying a new force_output configuration variable and setting
	  it to an enumerated constant, so that we can then implement a
	  simple switch() to set both the output dimension and output
	  flags correctly.

	  The possible bug was a call to pg_do_encoding_conversion w/out

	  - Use consistent formatting in reStructuredText; see
	  formatted result with rst2pdf or rst2html, or if you don't
	  want to install docutils, you can copy/paste the text to
	  http://www.tele3.cz/jbar/rest/rest.html
	  - Wrap lines to 80 columns, trim trailing whitespace, replace
	  tabs
	  with space chars
	  - Fix typos, and use consistent case and punctuation
	  - Alphabetize the directory structure
	  - Add ./libpgcommon to directory structure, and attempt to
	  describe it
	  - Arrange style of REQUIREMENTS section a bit more consistent
	  across components: removing repetition, stating what is required
	  or optional, etc.
	  - When referencing PostGIS SQL functions, use the "ST_" prefix,
	  where applicable
	  - Mention that both Raster and Topology extensions are built by
	  default, add notes how build without them

2012-03-09 19:00  dustymugs

	  This function computes the minimum tolerance for a given
	  geometry.
	  It works by computing the smallest floating point difference that
	  could be expressed on any vertex of the geometry.
	  
	  Currently it's only used to workaround the ST_DWithin/ST_Within
	  inconsistency (#1625) but could probably be used everytime 0 is
	  passed as a tolerance, possibly fixing #1641 as well.

2012-03-01 16:47  dustymugs

	  commit r9371

2012-02-13 22:02  pramsey

	* Configured without raster still tries to make
	  raster/rt_pg/rtpostgis.sql (#1575) only try to build extensions
	  if we have both raster and topology as well as pgsql 9.1

2012-02-13 21:58  pracine

	* Closing ticket #597. Added regression tests for ST_Clip. More
	  tests to come when fixing #1576.

2012-02-13 21:25  strk

2012-02-13 16:04  strk

	  permitted range. Ticket is #1568.

2012-02-10 22:42  pracine

	* ST_Clip returns all bands when no band is specified.

2012-02-10 22:36  pracine

	* Fix for ticket #1569. ST_Clip variants defaulting to band 1

2012-02-10 18:38  robe

	* #1494: move parent table creation to a function so logic is in
	  single place, add a new census_loader.sql script with census
	  specific load logic, revise create and update scripts to load the
	  new census logic and create tables if not present. Still need to
	  test and write a function to return census info given a point
	  before can mark this as done.

2012-02-10 17:05  pracine

	* Clamp SRID valuesu > SRID_MAXIMUM to fall in the reserved range
	  (#1505)
	  
	  The reserved range is SRID_USER_MAXIMUM+1 to SRID_MAXIMUM.
	  Core takes care of typmod clamping, postgis_restore.pl takes care

	* More postgis_config.h inclusion removal from headers

2012-02-09 17:00  strk

	* Drop postgis_config.h include from lwgeom_pg.h header.
	  
	  Generally, package config files should _not_ be included
	  by package headers. In this specific case the aim is overriding
	  POSTGIS_DEBUG_LEVEL in implementation files for the sake of
	  enabling debugging of a single file.
	  
	  Also part of this commit is addition of copyright header in
	  two files which were missing it (used git history to figure
	  assignments)

2012-02-09 17:00  strk

	* Fix header guard of pgsql_compat.h and drop the duplicate

2012-02-09 10:49  robe

	* ./configure still display the old raster version number (#1599)

2012-02-08 21:20  dustymugs

	* Instead of dynamically allocating space for variables "values"
	  and "nulls" with each pixel, just initialize both to the max
	  possible # of elements. Done for 2-raster ST_MapAlgebraExpr

2012-02-08 21:08  dustymugs

	* Remove deleted function signature for ST_PixelAsPolygon. Ticket
	  is #1529

	* Fix an issue in the shapefile GUI caused by saving the original
	  shapefile name before processing.
	  
	  This was a bug caused by having two separate passes during

	  export shapefile name during the first loop, and so when we came
	  to free() the temporary name
	  at the end of export it would only free the shapefile name from
	  the last iteration, and do it
	  multiple times causing random crashes.

	* Test roundtrip with a binary cursor for both geometry and
	  geography
	  
	  With this commit the binary.sql testcase doesn't test the actual
	  binary output anymore but rather uses canonical binary output to
	  copy objects to a temporary file, then uses canonical binary
	  input
	  to read the objects again into a new table and then compares the
	  original and the final tables.
	  
	  In order for this to work run_test was modified to pass a
	  :tmpfile
	  variable to testcases. Next stop: typmod for canonical binary
	  input.
	  
	  See ticket #850 for more info

2012-01-14 00:49  mcayland

	* Switch liblwgeom to use the POSTGIS_* defines already generated
	  by configure, rather than passing them in directly.
	  
	  Similar to my previous commit, however here the aim is that by
	  moving the logic outside of make then we can
	  potentially allow other generators (such as CMake) to detect and
	  use other compilers rather than embedding
	  specific -D flags into the command line.

2012-01-14 00:49  mcayland

	* Switch NLS build to use the in-built ENABLE_NLS define rather
	  than USE_NLS.
	  
	  The key concept here is that we eliminate all logic from the
	  Makefile and put
	  it in the build system (e.g. configure). By having the logic at
	  this higher
	  layer, we make it much easier to transition to another build
	  system in future
	  such as CMake.

2012-01-14 00:49  mcayland

	* Enable configure to accept the additional parameter
	  --with-gettext=no to disable NLS builds.
	  
	  This makes it possible to explicitly disable builds at configure
	  time if required for
	  platforms where this causes problems such as Windows (see bug
	  #748).

	  minus the
	  PACKAGE_* macros.

	  the same steps as the rest of PostGIS.

2012-01-09 22:43  dustymugs

	* Added column "out_db" to raster_columns. "out_db" is of type
	  boolean[] with each element indicating if that band of same index
	  is out-of-database. Updated relevant AddRasterConstraints and
	  DropRasterConstraints functions. Related ticket is #1440.

	  call to rt_band_destroy() properly frees the memory.

2012-01-09 19:48  dustymugs

	* Add read-only support for band data located outside the database
	  in raster files. All "get" and analysis functions should work for
	  out of database bands. Related ticket is #1440. Also added a test
	  raster file for use by an out of db band and future use for
	  raster2pgsql loader regression tests.

	* Commit reworked version of shp2pgsql-gui to the repository.
	  
	  As per my email to postgis-devel, this commit contains a major
	  reworking
	  of the inner core, with many bugfixes. The primary changes are:
	  
	  - Elimination of FILENODE, since we can just use pointers to
	  SHPLOADERCONFIG
	  
	  - Abstract the configuration structures from the GUI interface
	  
	  - Restrict entry to either drag/drop or file chooser
	  
	  - Instead of constantly destroying/creating new dialogs, create
	  them once and then just show/hide them (in particular this
	  enables the file chooser to open at its previous directory)
	  
	  - Add separate connection details and progress bar dialogs
	  
	  - Rework both internals and GUI in preparation for adding dumper
	  support
	  
	  Note that the dumper integration changes are being worked on
	  separately
	  and will be included in a later commit.

2012-01-08 19:15  robe

	* Fix typo in manual and more description about schema.
	  Evidentially some people do try to read the manual and make sense

2012-01-08 07:29  robe

	  convexhull instead of raster when result type is raster or
	  geometry

2012-01-08 06:49  robe

	* revise to recognize array of raster arguments

2012-01-08 06:26  robe

	  rt_raster_from_gdal_dataset() when the natural block width is the
	  raster width. Enhanced testing in testapi.c.

	  correct misstatement in geography code as to the ordering of args

2011-12-24 01:14  dustymugs

	* Instead of using spatial reference text in WKT format, use PROJ.4

	  removing a memory context that palloc has allocated things

	  get emptied upon call to SPI_finish).

	  which is more complex)

2011-11-21 12:03  strk

	* Have gserialized_get_gbox_p always return a round-to-float box
	  
	  That is, even when computing the box from scratch.
	  This makes the box always float-oriented,
	  consistently between cached and computed boxes.

2011-11-05 14:28  dustymugs

	* Moved postgis_gdal_version() from rtpostgis.sql.in.c to
	  postgis.sql.in.c. Added additional sed command to
	  postgis/Makefile.in to handle RASTER_MODULE_PATH so as to
	  continue using the underlyiing RASTER_gdal_version().
	  
	  Associated ticket is #1266.

	  management more separate from higher (TopoGeometry) management.

2011-10-21 21:42  dustymugs

	* Added rt_raster_set_geotransform_matrix() to provide quick
	  setting of a raster's geotransform based upon the matrix

2011-10-21 19:10  dustymugs

	* Corrected rt_raster_same_alignment() and RASTER_sameAlignment()
	  to behave as an end-user would expect it to. So intead of errors
	  when parameters don't match, return false.

2011-10-21 18:11  dustymugs

	* Changed rt_raster_has_no_band to use 0-based band index instead
	  of 1-based. Removed function prototype ST_HasNoData(raster) as
	  the other prototype ST_HasNoData(raster, nband) now uses the
	  default value of 1 for nband.

2011-10-21 14:53  dustymugs

	* Changed those functions that is 1-based for band index to 0-based
	  in rt_core. This leaves only rt_raster_has_no_band, which may
	  have other issues as well.
	  
	  Associated ticket is #754

2011-10-20 22:07  dustymugs

	* Removed use of PG_DETOAST_DATUM_COPY and PG_FREE_IF_COPY as all
	  rasters should be detoasted using PG_DETOAST_DATUM as it doesn't
	  create a copy, thus consuming more space.

2011-10-20 13:31  dzwarg

	  of arg names in _ST_AsRaster

2011-10-13 11:56  robe

	* Some functions need to be dropped before upgrade minor if they
	  need to be recreated. This is required for functions where
	  argument names change but fundamental types do not. Will add this
	  to upgrade minor script build later.

2011-10-12 14:36  dustymugs

	* Bug fix for _ST_Intersects(geometry, raster) where the buffering
	  of the intersection could return NULL. This happens if the buffer
	  was passed zero for the buffer distance.

2011-10-12 12:51  robe

	* move ST_AddBand to raster constructors section per ticket #1240

	  upgrade scripts. I didn't do any with this commit.

	  results to expect -1 being transformed to 0 (current official
	  UNKNOWN SRID value).

2011-10-10 19:25  strk

	* Do not use AddGeometryColumn, to avoid having to write an
	  explicit unknown SRID value.

2011-10-10 17:50  strk

	  ST_Transform, use 999xxx range for them. See ticket #1230.

2011-10-07 00:29  dustymugs

	* Added additional error checking and error messages to
	  ST_SameAlignment function

2011-10-05 18:55  dustymugs

	* Fixed --with-gdalconfig parameter as per ticket #1167.

2011-10-05 18:49  dustymugs

	* As per Bryce's comments in ticket #1174, reduce the number of
	  calculations when doing rt_raster_geopoint_to_cell by using an
	  inverse geotransform matrix. Unlike the patch attached to the
	  ticket, this commit does not change the structure of the
	  rt_raster struct. It may be worth changing the rt_raster struct
	  eventually, but will cost us the single memcpy when serializing
	  rt_raster. Also, changes for testing SRID as "unknown" if value
	  is lte SRID_UNKNOWN (presently 0).
	  
	  Associated ticket is #1174.

2011-10-05 04:54  dustymugs

	* Removed hackish use of POSTGIS_GDAL_VERSION in
	  postgis/sqldefines.h.in and postgis/postgis.sql.in.c. Added
	  conditional compilation of extent resizing based upon GDAL
	  version in rt_api.c

2011-10-04 23:32  dustymugs

	* Fixed bug where a call to postgis_full_version causes error if
	  postgis_gdal_version doesn't exist because raster support is not
	  included

2011-10-04 23:13  strk

	* don't try to call postgis_gdal_version() if not testing raster
	  (the signature is unavailable)

2011-10-04 22:38  dustymugs

	* Adds postgis_gdal_version() function as per ticket #1225.

2011-10-04 20:51  dustymugs

	* Changed adjustment of extent by half-pixel to full-pixel for
	  points and linestrings to ensure compatibility with GDAL 1.6, 1.7
	  and 1.8. GDAL 1.9 (current trunk) appears to work fine with
	  half-pixel adjustments.

2011-10-04 20:46  robe

	* add KNN GIST + credits to news release (was already in docs)

2011-10-04 14:33  strk

	* Tweak expected test output to expect unknown srid to be reported
	  as 0
	  
	  If this will change before release, git-revert is our friend

2011-10-04 14:33  strk

	* Make topology.CreateTopology unknown-srid-agnostic (uses ST_Srid
	  to tell)
	  
	  Hopefully this makes the topology code stable during the SRID
	  fights :)

2011-10-03 15:29  robe

	* Guess Nicklas was right - should have looked at my explain.
	  Revised example to use geometry constants. Seems to be a
	  limitation in KNN that it needs constants. Same annoying behavior
	  with my trigram KNN that only constant phrases work, not even
	  constant phrases wrapped in alias work.

	* Drop more non-ascii dashes, update regress tests (#1226)

	  There's a still-failing regress test due to SRID 0 being
	  considered != 1

	* Add in st_valuecount evidentally changed output in 2.0 series

2011-10-02 14:12  dustymugs

	* fixed _st_intersects(raster, geometry, integer) where call to
	  ST_Intersects was hardcoding the first band of raster instead of
	  using user-provided nband.

2011-10-02 03:18  robe

	* preliminary logic to build an rtpostgis_upgrade_20_minor.sql
	  script. Still missing a drop somewhere since my older db doesn't
	  upgrade because complains about out parameters changed in some
	  function.

2011-10-01 17:28  dustymugs

2011-07-04 17:32  robe

	* #1076 more work toward Highway geocoding -- significant rework of
	  original patch. Still need to parse out the direction information

2011-07-04 15:50  strk

	* Drop dangling reference to Probe_Geometry_Columns (see #1083)

2011-07-04 15:40  strk

	* A couple more tests for btree against points: different points,
	  differently cached boxes

2011-07-04 15:34  strk

	* Have pglwgeom_getbox2d_p compute a bounding box when not cached.
	  Fixes #1023.

2011-07-04 15:12  strk

	* Document pglwgeom_getbox2d_p. See
	  http://trac.osgeo.org/postgis/ticket/1023

2011-07-04 14:50  strk

	* More unit test memory leaks and compiler warnings fixed

2011-07-04 14:14  strk

	* Add test for btree equality of points (#1023)

2011-07-04 13:56  strk

	* Do not deep-free return from lwcollection_homogenize as it
	  doesn't copy POINTARRAY memory. See #1104.

2011-07-04 12:29  strk

	* Plug some memory leaks in the unit tests, to help finding
	  lower-level ones...

2011-07-04 12:29  strk

	* Document memory management of lwdoubles_to_latlon and
	  lwpoint_to_latlon

2011-07-04 11:24  strk

	* Fix support for MULTICURVEZM and make TIN spelling conformant to
	  other (MixedCase). Add cohomprensive regress test for
	  postgis_type_name(). Closes bug #1096 once again.

2011-07-04 11:24  strk

	* Add missing circular types to geomtype_struct_array, fixing bug
	  #1094

2011-07-04 11:24  strk

	* Do not hard-code lenght of geomtype struct array (See #1094)

2011-07-04 10:10  strk

	* AddGeometryColumn: when complaining about unknown geometry type
	  also report the used name and dimensions (see related bug #1096)

2011-07-04 10:02  strk

	* Fix unused variable warning when building against GEOS >= 3.3

2011-07-04 09:26  mcayland

	* Make all PostGIS object files depend upon liblwgeom, so that if
	  liblwgeom is
	  changed then it also triggers a (complete) rebuild of PostGIS.
	  
	  Note as documented in #447 this is an over-cautious approach
	  since it rebuilds
	  all of PostGIS if liblwgeom changes, but at least its a starting
	  point and
	  does actually solve the case whereby a user updates liblwgeom but
	  doesn't
	  force a rebuild of PostGIS.

2011-07-04 09:09  strk

	* typo

2011-07-04 09:07  strk

	  ticket #1101.

2011-07-04 09:00  strk

	* Do not manually delete rows from geometry_columns (which is now a
	  view). Closes ticket #1099.

2011-07-04 07:35  robe

	* Partial fix for #1076, county roads and highways, but think I
	  might have broken the SELECT (addy).*,* from geocode('16725
	  Rockford Road, Plymouth, MN 55447') or my data is bad

2011-07-03 21:47  mcayland

	* Fix for #1088: Too many columns in select crashes pgsql2shp.
	  
	  Instead of a fixed length query string, dynamically allocate the
	  memory based
	  upon the sum of the lengths of all of the column names.

2011-07-03 16:51  robe

	* #1087 improve rating algorithm. also start to use prepared
	  statements where appropriate (don't put state in prepared part
	  since that would prevent constraint exclusion from kicking in)

2011-07-03 10:45  robe

	* Add more tests, minor cleanup

2011-07-03 05:03  robe

	* Update credits and release notes to include change in
	  geometry_columns and management functions, add ST_OffSetCurve to
	  release_notes.xml, add Rafal Magda to people credits list

2011-07-03 01:58  robe

	* more column width cleanup

2011-07-03 01:52  robe

	* #1095 clarification of what is mean by geometry_columns not
	  supporting views built the old constraint way

2011-07-02 17:53  robe

	* missed a spot

2011-07-02 17:52  robe

	* add missing para end tag

2011-07-02 17:25  robe

	* start describing management functions how typmod changes things
	  --- Populate_geometry_columns, dropgeometrytable,
	  dropgeometrycolumn. More to go.

2011-07-02 16:52  robe

	* #1096 can't create 2.5d linestrings

2011-07-02 16:29  robe

	* revise template to give example of optional argument

2011-07-02 13:43  mcayland

	* Update loader regression test suite to add a simple test for
	  shp2pgsql (much as we now do for pgsql2shp).
	  
	  Note that these tests aren't completely comprehensive and should
	  be expanded, with the long term aim
	  of moving the loader regression tests out of the main regression
	  harness and into CUnit instead.

2011-07-02 12:34  mcayland

	* Fix up the loader unit tests so that if --with-gui is not passed
	  to configure, the non-GUI tests will continute to run instead of
	  failing compilation.

2011-07-02 09:27  robe

	* revise wmsservers_new to use new typmod and not directly delete
	  and add to geometry_columns so passes regress

2011-07-02 08:58  robe

	* #944, #1081, #1083, #1088, #1084: Convert geometry_columns to a
	  view, revise management functions to not update/delete from
	  geometry_columns and to support typmod. Will use typmod behavior
	  as default
	  fix typos in postgis_type_name and delete from geometry_column
	  calls in regress.

2011-07-01 22:36  mcayland

	* Another attempt to fix #1080 on Windows - it seems that simply
	  opening and
	  closing a pgsql2shp state object is a good way to find all
	  uninitialised
	  variables.

2011-07-01 21:37  mcayland

	* Revised fix for #1080 based upon backtrace provided by Regina.

2011-07-01 21:32  robe

	* #1082 get rid of delete from geometry_columns call. Also cleanup
	  argument list to make more modern

2011-07-01 14:34  robe

	* Benchmark notes

2011-07-01 13:45  robe

2011-07-01 13:10  robe

	* convert to CREATE OR REPLACE postgis_constraint_srid

2011-07-01 12:59  robe

	* put in associated ticket numbers change to unaligned format for
	  easier diffing, add in script to run test suite. Force LF and put
	  svn keywords

2011-07-01 11:47  strk

	* Add 2 more testcases for ST_OffsetCurve, one of which returning a
	  MULTILINESTRING

2011-07-01 10:59  strk

	* Use choice="opt" to encode default parameter for ST_OffsetCurve

2011-07-01 10:36  strk

	* Well, let's run the ST_OffsetCurve regress test only against
	  GEOS-3.3. After all it's known to fail against 3.2 ... (due to
	  http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/ticket/455#comment:1)

2011-07-01 10:14  strk

	* Test LINESTRING EMPTY return from ST_OffsetCurve

2011-07-01 10:10  strk

	* Properly convert typed empties coming from GEOS.

2011-07-01 10:10  strk

	* Add ST_OffsetCurve news item

2011-07-01 09:56  strk

	* Add ST_OffsetCurve function supporting both GEOS-3.2 and
	  GEOS-3.3+. Uses distance parameter sign to derive left/right
	  side. Includes regress testing and documentation. Based on patch
	  by Rafal Magda.

2011-07-01 09:33  mcayland

	* Fix #1080: cunit is crashing on test_ShpDumerDestroy().
	  
	  Looks like the original code omitted to set the default config
	  values causing
	  the addition of a ShpDumperDestroy() call to fall over on some
	  platforms due
	  to uninitialised pointers.

2011-07-01 06:17  robe

	* Force unix LF. Also get rid of unnecessary call to CREATE INDEX
	  .. we have a missing script for that.

2011-07-01 02:22  robe

	* Fix for #1086 Issue with parsing out location. also added to
	  regression tests

2011-07-01 00:02  robe

	* fix build -- had functions installed out of order of dependency

2011-06-30 19:18  robe

	* add pretty function to return pretty name and use in
	  postgis_constraint_type (seems 3 times as slow with conversion --
	  will investigate later) -- before my 50 odd goemetry_columns
	  based on all constraint columns returns 75ms now takes 250-300
	  ms.

2011-06-30 17:16  dustymugs

	* removed accidental commit of some debug testing

2011-06-30 13:28  dustymugs

2011-06-29 23:14  pramsey

	* Change parameter order in 900913 (magic!)

2011-06-29 22:40  mcayland

	* Commit rework of #885 (pgsql2shp fields conversion from
	  predefined list).
	  
	  This patch required extra work to ensure that it was a better fit
	  for the
	  new loader/dumper structure including error reporting, better use
	  of C
	  coding style and altering various names/code locations as
	  appropriate.

2011-06-29 22:40  pramsey

	* GEOS no like POINT EMPTY (#1060)

2011-06-29 21:10  robe

2011-06-29 05:06  robe

	* fix for #1073 handling mangled zipcodes and update regress to
	  include these

2011-06-29 04:23  robe

	* #1077 preliminary regress tests and current outputs (formatting
	  needs cleanup and to be run by script but will deal with that
	  later). Already have a regress failure when compared with docs.

2011-06-28 19:36  strk

	* Simplify layertrigger tests dropping unneeded operations. The
	  reduction was verified to still trigger bug #950 prior to the fix
	  for it.

2011-06-28 19:36  strk

	* Apply patch by Andrea Peri to fix topology layer trigger.
	  Includes regress test. Closes ticket #950.

2011-06-28 14:26  robe

	  instead of windows batch style commented alter schema

2011-06-28 12:21  robe

	* put in missing homage to GDAL. Also updated the GDAL use list
	  http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/SoftwareUsingGdal to include
	  PostGIS

2011-06-28 03:55  robe

	* Partial fix for #1068 -- handling of misspelled numeric streets
	  such as 13nd or 22th and partial support for numeric streets with
	  fractions like 1/2

2011-06-28 02:50  robe

	* get rid of drop / recreate norm_addy. It's not necessary yet
	  since we haven't changed it.

2011-06-28 01:27  robe

	* #1068 partial fix -- trimmed leading/trailing spaces in
	  normalize_address fields so now correctly handles things like
	  W.,N. etc. More fixes coming.

2011-06-27 21:35  dustymugs

	* - wrote function getSRTextSPI to create one code for getting the
	  srtext of a SRID from the spatial_ref_sys table.
	  - removed plpgsql function _ST_srtext with addition of
	  getSRTextSPI.
	  
	  The regression failure in ticket #1064 should be resolved as a
	  side-affect of the new function as the srtext returned through
	  SPI is copied to an interval variable.

2011-06-27 19:31  pramsey

	* Ignore GNUMakefile

2011-06-27 19:24  pramsey

2011-06-27 16:47  mcayland

	* Edit rt_band_get_pixel() so that the warning message contains the
	  out-of-bound coordinates being accessed.

2011-06-27 14:35  dustymugs

	* Cleanup of error messages.

2011-06-27 01:53  robe

	* version garden test files so now named raster_gardentest_20.sql,
	  postgis_gardentest_20.sql. Add reclassarg type example to raster
	  garden objects

2011-06-26 19:44  robe

	  output table name

2011-06-26 18:18  robe

2011-06-25 19:20  dustymugs

	* Modified ST_Transform to permit specification of projected
	  raster's scale. This is due to the scale change that occurs when
	  a raster is being reprojected.

2011-06-25 18:15  robe

	* bounding box clarification && (that it's 2D)

2011-06-25 18:14  robe

2011-06-24 23:18  robe

	* bah pdflatex doesn't like sect3. Just make it a sect2

2011-06-24 21:49  robe

	* Id on para didn't take -- lets try a sect3

2011-06-24 21:20  dustymugs

	* Added sanitization of the algorithm parameter of ST_Transform.
	  Refactored the regression test for ST_Transform.

2011-06-24 16:30  robe

	* put in ancho for changed section and link back from top of What's
	  new to breaking changes section

2011-06-24 16:14  robe

	* revise 2.0 changed,enhanced, new to also capture paragraphs
	  embedded in sub tags such as warning, note. Was missing some
	  breaking changes ST_Length, ST_GeomFromText etc because it wasn't
	  catching warnings

2011-06-24 14:25  robe

	* thought had changed to use default params -- guess not. Also
	  stamp in time author info as comment inside function

2011-06-24 13:02  robe

2011-06-23 21:08  robe

	* put in author revision id placeholder and have as part of code
	  logic as well

2011-06-23 20:46  dustymugs

	* Removed rt_raster_transform from rt_api.c and any calls to it
	  since rt_raster_gdal_warp has same results for reprojections.

2011-06-23 20:29  dustymugs

	* Addition of rt_raster_gdal_warp function in rt_api.c. This was
	  written based upon GDAL's gdalwarp utility to provide a flexible
	  means to reproject, change the scale of, adjust the skew (deskew)
	  of and shift the origin of a raster. RASTER_transform in rt_pg.c
	  has been adjusted to make use of rt_raster_gdal_warp instead of
	  rt_raster_transform. Regression te
	  sts confirm that resulting rasters from rt_raster_gdal_warp are
	  identical to that of rt_raster_transform.
	  
	  The abilities to change a raster's scale, skew and origin have
	  yet to be tested and have no user-accessible SQL functions as of
	  this revision. This will occur in future revisions.
	  
	  The function rt_raster_transform will be removed in a future
	  revision.

2011-06-23 11:07  robe

	* #944 support functions to comb out type,srid, dim from constraint

	  non-typmods and typmods of the world can coexist in harmony

2011-06-23 11:01  strk

	* Fill in raster coverage protos for ST_Histogram (still need
	  examples for these), fix typo in another function, change
	  ST_SetBandNoDataValue as if it supports default args (the
	  documentation will be consistent with implementation onces #1049
	  is done)

	* more fine tuning of output of driver options

2011-06-21 05:25  robe

	* Fix ST_GDalDrivers output to correctly output options as table. I
	  had thought it was evenly balanced (all options have
	  descriptions), but that is not the case so origianl example had
	  the name and descriptions mismatched

2011-06-21 05:05  dustymugs

	* Refactored code and removed the use of SET_VARSIZE for
	  RASTER_band to fix segfault.
	  
	  Associated ticket is #1044.

2011-06-20 09:29  robe

	* #1040 -- ST_MinimumBoundingCircle -- replace X(), Y() deprecated
	  calls with ST_X(), ST_Y(). Also changed to use default args. We
	  really need regression tests for this function. Will put on
	  separate task.

2011-06-19 06:24  robe

	* more cleanup of hard upgrade instructions

2011-06-19 05:52  robe

	* Amend hard upgrade instructions to remove stuff that is obsolete

	  creating new spatial database to include instructions for
	  installing raster and topology support

2011-06-19 00:31  robe

	* backout some code didn't mean to commit

2011-06-18 07:29  robe

	* Found some indexes I missed -- added to tiger_loader, also #1036
	  create missing_indexes generation script to back install. Still
	  need to put in logic for some more indexes, but htis is a good
	  start. Also documented new function

	* fixed parameter passing in ST_AsTiff

2011-06-17 15:16  dustymugs

	* Refactored ST_SummaryStats so that there is a non-user
	  _ST_SummaryStats that is the backend of all ST_SummaryStats and
	  ST_ApproxSummary stats functions. This eliminates the
	  "sample_percent" parameter from the one ST_SummaryStats function
	  that had it.

2011-06-16 21:01  pramsey

	* Partial typmod support for PostGIS geometry (#944)

2011-06-15 20:22  pramsey

	* Add a couple more GBOX functions to map to B2DF4 requirements

2011-06-15 15:43  dustymugs

	* Changed band pixel types to 64BF instead of 32BF so that the
	  warning messages for data getting converted are mitigated.

2011-06-15 14:29  dustymugs

	* Added value for nBandCount attribute of GDALWarpOptions in
	  rt_raster_transform function.
	  
	  This is based upon the discussion found at:
	  
	  http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/gdal-dev/2011-May/028730.html
	  
	  Related ticket is #1015

2011-06-15 12:44  robe

	* #722 - get rid of transform and remainder of SnapToGrid
	  deprecated family of functions. Add to #945 uninstall_legacy and
	  also legacy.sql.in.c files

2011-06-15 01:25  robe

	* Change ST_MapAlgebra to use default args and amend the
	  documentation to reflect change. In so doing fix #969 -
	  inconsistent order of args, #967 raster regress failures on 9.0
	  and 9.1

2011-06-14 19:32  dustymugs

	* Changed SRID to something within the range permitted by
	  GSERIALIZED. As of this revision, all raster regression tests
	  pass successfully.

2011-06-14 16:21  pramsey

	* bug in BOX2DFLOAT4_in function due to GSERIALIZED_ON change
	  (#1020)

2011-06-14 16:04  dustymugs

	* With GSERIALIZED_ON enabled, adapted code that needs preprocessor
	  conditions. Basically instead of "geometry_gist_sel" and
	  "geometry_gist_joinsel", GSERIALIZED_ON uses "contsel" and
	  "contjoinsel"

2011-06-14 08:20  strk

	* Do not explicitly name GIST opclass (was renamed). Fixes topology
	  after the GSERIALIZED switch.

2011-06-14 08:20  strk

	* Fix libiconv linker flags

2011-06-14 04:26  pramsey

	* Apply bug in BOX2DFLOAT4_in function due to GSERIALIZED_ON change
	  (#1020) from dustymugs

2011-06-13 21:47  dustymugs

	* Fixed memory leak in RASTER_asGDALRaster of rt_pg.c and left note
	  in comments of rt_raster_to_gdal

2011-06-13 21:31  pramsey

	* Move from GSERIALIZED off by default to on by default. Adjust
	  minor regression changes as necessary.

2011-06-13 20:20  pramsey

	* Allow cunit tests to build and run in OS/X

2011-06-13 19:51  pramsey

	* Add svn:ignores for some new derived files.

2011-06-13 12:30  robe

2011-06-13 01:31  robe

	* change to return as much address as possible even if no fullname
	  at least try to return city, state, zip

2011-06-12 14:33  robe

	* fix typo in reverse_geocode name and get rid of other prot since
	  changed to use default args

2011-06-12 06:34  robe

	* fix division by zero issue

2011-06-12 04:55  robe

	* make debug statement conditional

2011-06-12 04:52  robe

	* significantly improve speed of reverse geocode (when all states
	  loaded), but using CTEs and unparameterizing query (parameterized
	  often does not use inheritance), reverse_geocode to use default
	  parameters, put in table column comments to describe some of what
	  loader columns mean.

2011-06-11 19:26  dustymugs

	* Added function parameter "header_only" to rt_raster_deserialize.
	  This instructs the function to only extract the raster header.
	  
	  All functions calls to rt_raster_deserialize in rt_pg.c and
	  testwkb.c have been modified to account for the "header_only"
	  parameter. In addition, functions that can use
	  PG_DETOAST_DATUM_SLICE have been modified to use it.
	  
	  Associated tickets are #867 and #985.
	  
	  Now to work on valgrinding rt_pg.c

2011-06-11 19:06  dustymugs

	* Removed the ST_SummaryStats wrappers: ST_Sum, ST_Mean, ST_Stddev,
	  ST_MinMax. Only ST_Count is preserved as it has a shortcut for
	  when "exclude_nodata_value" is FALSE.
	  
	  Refactored regression test for rt_transform due to removal of
	  some ST_SummaryStats wrappers and make the tests no longer about
	  being exact to specific values but more about being in the
	  appropriate contexts.
	  
	  Associated ticket is #1005 and to some degree, #985.

2011-06-11 13:41  robe

	* Sort what's new 2.0 by name of section insted of id since raster
	  ids start with RT_ they are being sorted at the top above
	  everything else which is confusing

2011-06-11 05:27  robe

	* Fix ST_BandMetaData, ST_AsGDalRaster (they take defaults now so
	  prots have ben removed)

2011-06-11 04:59  dustymugs

	* Refactored rt_raster_replace_band in rt_api.c to return the
	  replaced band.
	  Additional memory cleanups in testapi.c due to segfault and
	  leaks.

2011-06-11 01:09  robe

	* Note about issues with raster ST_Transform

2011-06-11 00:43  robe

	* document raster ST_Transform function. Will provide examples
	  later.

2011-06-11 00:05  dustymugs

	* Fixed bunch of memory leaks in rt_api.c and testapi.c. Will need
	  to valgrind the regression tests to clean up the leaks in rt_pg.c

2011-06-10 23:19  robe

	* get rid of ST_SRSText usage is gone and replaced with just srid
	  so parallel with geometry. Update all the function doco -- they
	  used to use srstext, but now they use srid.

2011-06-10 23:01  dustymugs

	* Refactored how GDAL warp options are freed. I believe I was
	  prematurely freeing the options.
	  
	  Associated ticket #1015

2011-06-10 19:49  pracine

	* Getting pixel value at out of range coordinate should only return
	  a warning. Was broken at r7106. Added a check.

2011-06-10 18:18  dustymugs

	* Fixed error messages.

2011-06-10 18:14  dustymugs

	* Explicitly set GDALWarpOptions element padfSrcNoDataImag as it
	  seems some folks are having regression error. Based upon the GDAL
	  code, explicitly setting padfSrcNoDataImag and padfDstNoDataImag
	  should eliminate the error message that is occurring.
	  
	  Associated tickets are #925 and #1015.

2011-06-10 17:24  robe

	* #609 jdbc error in documentation

2011-06-10 17:00  robe

	* #666 -- strange I don't recall this being an issue on PostGIS
	  2.0, but seems to be also. Still need regress test for it though.

2011-06-10 16:16  pramsey

	* Update NZ projections for grid transformation support (#631)

2011-06-10 15:19  dustymugs

	* Rewrote ST_BandMetaData to use a C function instead of sequential
	  calls for the metadata of a raster's band in plpgsql. Also added
	  regression tests for ST_MetaData and ST_BandMetaData due to C
	  functions.
	  
	  Associated ticket #1012

2011-06-10 05:13  robe

	* more description on reclass expressions

2011-06-10 01:52  robe

2011-06-09 21:15  dustymugs

	* Rewrote ST_Metadata to make use of a C function instead of
	  sequential calls for the metadata of a raster in plpgsql.
	  
	  Associated ticket #1012

	* Bad handling of Inf values in GEOS (#1013)

2011-06-09 20:32  robe

	* #448 add CUnit requirement for testing

2011-06-09 18:55  dustymugs

	* Replaced the parameter "srs" in ST_AsGDALRaster with "srid" so as
	  to match that of ST_Transform and other functions that deals with
	  spatial reference systems. In doing so, this eliminates the user
	  function ST_srtext and just has a hidden _ST_srtext function for
	  use by the underlying C functions. Another nice benefit is that I
	  was able to reduce the number of user-facing functions.
	  
	  Associated ticket #1011

2011-06-09 16:01  robe

	* #1009 typo in index creation

2011-06-08 22:47  dustymugs

	* - added additional tests that shouldn't require datum shift files
	  for proj.4.
	  - refactored output that would be double precision to be rounded

2011-06-08 21:10  dustymugs

	* Rewrote how the standard/sample deviation is computed in
	  ST_SummaryStats for coverage tables. It now extends the existing
	  use of a single-pass standard deviation calculation to be able to
	  do the calculation for a coverage table.
	  
	  Associated ticket #985.

2011-06-08 00:10  dustymugs

	* forgot to comment out debug code for ST_Histogram thus causing
	  rt_histogram regression to fail

2011-06-08 00:00  dustymugs

	* fixed ST_SummaryStats for coverage tables where the sum of all
	  tiles was not being computed.
	  Associated ticket #1005
	  
	  Also added shortcuts to ST_Count for when parameter
	  "exclude_nodata_value" is FALSE, just compute the count based
	  upon the raster's dimensions. Performance difference between the
	  normal route and the shortcut is negligible for small rasters but
	  noticable when run on large rasters and coverage tables

2011-06-07 22:59  dustymugs

	* Added support for coverage tables to ST_Histogram. This entailed
	  adding the ability to explicitly specify the min and max values
	  in the underlying C function rt_band_get_histogram. The min and
	  max parameters should ONLY be used by the established coverage
	  table handling ST_Histogram functions as the returned percent
	  element of the histogram type is changed from returning the
	  percentage to returning the sum of counts for that histogram.
	  
	  Associated ticket is #934.

2011-06-07 18:21  dustymugs

	* Add ST_Transform function that achieves the primary purpose of
	  reprojecting a raster to a new projection system. This makes use
	  of the GDAL Warp API function GDALAutoCreateWarpedVRT(). In the
	  future, the underlying C function is expected to be refactored to
	  support skewing and pixel scaling at the same time the raster is
	  reprojected.
	  
	  Really minor changes to rt_pg/rt_pg.c adding initilization values
	  to variables for eliminating compile warnings in Windows (thanks
	  Pierre).
	  
	  Fixed variable "status" in rt_raster_from_gdal_dataset() of
	  rt_core/rt_api.c
	  
	  Associated ticket is #925

2011-06-07 13:04  robe

	* Put legacy.sql in varname tag so prints out as courier and stands
	  out more. Some clarification on the geography/geometry choice

	  loop at line 5442

2011-06-05 20:52  dustymugs

	* - added additional function parameters "bandNums" and "count" to
	  rt_raster_to_gdal_mem so that the GDAL dataset created only
	  contains those bands specified
	  - any calls to rt_raster_to_gdal_mem function was refactored for
	  the new function parameters
	  - refactored rt_raster_dump_as_wktpolygons to make use of
	  rt_raster_to_gdal_mem so as to reduce duplicate code and improve
	  cleanliness

	* huh more mistakes in ST_Reclass

2011-06-03 17:02  dustymugs

	* Added rt_raster_from_gdal_dataset function to rt_core/rt_api.c.
	  This function provides the functionality needed to convert a GDAL
	  dataset into a PostGIS Raster object.

2011-06-03 15:19  jorgearevalo

	* Check for new GDALFPolygonize function. If it isn't present, the
	  old GDALPolygonize is called. Related ticket #650.

2011-06-01 08:17  robe

	* move raster types to raster section (there are way too many now

	  Assocated ticket is #990
	  
	  Also specified STRICT for functions with "searchvalue" (the
	  singular) argument.

2011-05-26 15:43  dustymugs

	* Changed the datatype for "count" from integer to bigint. This

	  raster/scripts/python, which itself requires psycopg2.
	  - Refactored rt_asgdalraster.sql, rt_astiff.sql, rt_asjpeg.sql

	* Changes in raster memory management:
	  - Only calling function memory context is used, except in SRF
	  functions, where
	  multi_call_memory_ctx is used.
	  - rt_context internals hidden. The memory management and error
	  reporting is
	  performed by rtalloc/rterror family functions. They simply call
	  rt_context
	  struct fields as requested. Same philosophy here than in
	  liblwgeom.
	  - Now rt_context memory is statically allocated. Before this, new
	  memory for
	  rt_context was allocated in every function call. And the memory
	  was allocated
	  outside the calling function (in fcinfo->flinfo->fn_mcxt postgres
	  memory
	  context).

	  which is right. One of these has the address orientations flipped
	  (odd /even not right). Of course I have to be right :). Boy do I

2010-11-18 05:28  pramsey

	* An argument for git. This massive commit includes the renaming of
	  function in the ptarray API, the removal of some pointArray_*
	  variants in favor of ptarray_* variants, and, importantly, the
	  adition of _append_point and _insert_point options for
	  pointarrays. Functions have been switched over to using the API
	  instead of managing the serialized_pointlist themselves. This has
	  necessitated the re-writing of some functions. Simplify2d and
	  Force2d have been re-written as lwgeom functions instead of
	  serialized form functions, and moved into liblwgeom. There are
	  still some major functions to move into liblwgeom, including the
	  point_in_polygon functions that support the intersects shortcuts
	  and the linear referencing fuctions in lwgeom_functions_analytic.

	  not supported. Fixed by adding a new function especially designed
	  for escaping arguments for PQconnectdb strings, and plugging it
	  into the GUI.
	  
	  Note this commit is different from the 1.5 branch version, since
	  the escaping function is moved into a new common library as I can
	  see it being required for the new pgsql2shp CLI in the not too
	  distant future.

2010-09-10 12:58  mcayland

	  version folder (this is a little bit of a hack since we can't
	  merge PGXS into the main Makefile directly, but it works).

2010-09-10 08:50  mcayland

	* Fix #581: LWGEOM_expand produces inconsistent results. Change the
	  bounding box calculation routines in ptarray.c so that they
	  perform the entire calculation in double precision then convert
	  the final result to BOX2DFLOAT4. This prevents rounding errors
	  being introduced into the bounding box when each input result is
	  converted to BOX2DFLOAT4 in turn.

	  could happen if a user-defined query doesn't return any results,

	  collection types re-sizable: added maxgeoms to all collections,
